# hurdlr
This is a package for modeling zero-inflated count data in a Bayesian hierarchical regression framework. The package will unify many of the basic zero-inflated and hurdle models such as ZIP and ZINB, but the main unique feature of the package is the functionality to perform a double-hurdle model, used to fit data that are simultaneously zero-inflated and extremely overdispersed.
